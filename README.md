# TPMI Random Map Generator
I have made the least amount of changes to make this work standalone.
Written in node.js

If you're just looking to use the bot join this discord to access the bot command that does it for you: https://discord.gg/JBy3BtN

Run `$help` inside the discord to get a rundown of what the bot does.

Clone the repo, run `npm i` to install packages, then run `node index.js` to generate a single map.
But really if you didn't understand how to do that already, I doubt you'd be able to understand this mess of code.

Map Generation logic is inside `random_map.js`

Generated files are exported to `/generated`.
